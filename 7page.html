<p>My first time ever being on a volleyball court was at Gettysburg Elementary and I was in 5th grade. Evidently, it wasn't an actual volleyball court. Just a net in the middle of the grass field behind the baseball fields. When I found out that I had made the 'A' Team which consisted of a majority of 6th graders, I was terrified and refused to play. I convinced the coaches to let me stay on the 'B' Team.</p>
  <p>Once I got to the 6th grade, I felt more comfortable playing on the 'A' Team. Looking back at it, I really had a great time. Although, I don't think I was nearly as good as I thought I was. Once I was getting ready to begin the 7th grade, here came volleyball tryouts in an actual gym. Trying out for 7th grade volleyball was quite nerve wracking, but it was there that I met my best friend...to be continued.</p>

  <p class="description">Hello! My name is Christina Tran and I would like to welcome you to my volleyball blog. I have been playing volleyball for 12 years now. I started playing when I was in 5th grade. I have had quite the journey and wanted to create this blog to help upcoming volleyball players that need some advice or just basic tips. Whether you are just beginning or starting your recruiting process, this is the perfect place for you!</p>
